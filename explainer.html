        <h2>Motivation</h2>
            <ul class="bullet">
            <li>What is your dataset?</li>
            <p>Our dataset is "Incidents Responded to by Fire Companies" and it was obtained from the "NYC Open Data". It contains information about incidents handled by the New York City Fire Department. After responding to an incident, the New York City Fire Department complete modules on a system called "New York Fire Incident Reporting System". The used dataset comes from the data collected by this system.</p>
            <li>Why did you choose this/these particular dataset(s)?</li>
            <p>This dataset seemed like a good idea due to the massive amount of data it has, as well as due to the fact that it is filled by the Fire Department of New York directly. Although it does not contain the precise locations of the incidents, it was deemed enough to visualize the data using the ZIP code information.</p>
            <!--><p>Here we could say that we were also considering the other one that also has incidents but the other one is not filtered?</p><!-->
            <li>What was your goal for the end user’s experience?</li>
            <p>We wanted to present a page easy to navigate, with a nice and simple presentation that could draw attention from the user.</p>
            </ul>
