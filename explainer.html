        <h2>Motivation</h2>
            <ul class="bullet">
            <li>What is your dataset?</li>
            <p>Our dataset is "Incidents Responded to by Fire Companies" and it was obtained from the "NYC Open Data". It contains information about incidents handled by the New York City Fire Department. After responding to an incident, the New York City Fire Department complete modules on a system called "New York Fire Incident Reporting System". The used dataset comes from the data collected by this system.</p>
            <li>Why did you choose this/these particular dataset(s)?</li>
            <p>Here we could say that we were also considering the other one that also has incidents but the other one is not filtered?</p>
            <li>What was your goal for the end user’s experience?</li>
            <p>We wanted to present a page easy to navigate, with a nice and simple presentation that could draw attention from the user.</p>
            </ul>
        <h2>Basic stats. Let’s understand the dataset better</h2>
            <ul class="bullet">
            <li>Write about your choices in data cleaning and preprocessing</li>
            <p>The selected dataset is very large. In order to extract the necessary information in a way that could be easy and faster to access, we used the pandas library in Python to create csv files. Because the dataset contains zip codes, we used a New York GeoJSON that allowed us to create a heatmap displaying the number of incidents.<br>
            In order to present the number of incidents per number of residents, allowing to offer a real comparison between zones based on the number of people living there, we used a dataset that contained population from 2015 for every zip code.   </p>
            <li>Write a short section that discusses the dataset stats, containing key points/plots from your exploratory data analysis.</li>
            <p>For this project we used 5? csv files created using pandas library in Python. Here we discussed the use of this csvs and the use in the created plots:<br>
            - "zipcodesAll.csv": contains all the zip codes and the number of incidents occurred in that zip area, from 2013 to 2017. In javascript we calculate the number of incidents per 1000 residents using population dataset.<br>
            - incidents_year/.csv : contains a group of csv files divided by year. Each csv file contains information from the corresponding year, about the date of occurred incidents and the zip code area. This is used for the timeline.</p>
            </ul>
        <h2>Genre. Which genre of data story did you use?</h2>
            <ul class="bullet">
            <li>Which tools did you use from each of the 3 categories of Visual Narrative (Figure 7 in Segal and Heer). Why?</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Which tools did you use from each of the 3 categories of Narrative Structure (Figure 7 in Segal and Heer). Why?</li>
            <p></p>
            </ul>
        <h2>Visualizations.</h2>
            <ul class="bullet">
            <li>Explain the visualizations you’ve chosen.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Why are they right for the story you want to tell?</li>
            <p></p>
            </ul>
        <h2>Discussion. Think critically about your creation</h2>
            <ul class="bullet">
            <li>What went well?</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>What is still missing? What could be improved?, Why?</li>
            <p>We used Chrome for running and testing of the project. The code processes a lot of data and it seems that in other web browsers (ex. Firefox) it takes a long time to load the page. This is something that could be improved.</p>
            </ul>
